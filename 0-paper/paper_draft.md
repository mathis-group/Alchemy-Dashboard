# Visualizing an Algorithmic Artificial Chemistry for de novo functional exploration

## Abstract

- Artifical Chemistry aims to understand the self organization that leds to phenomena such as life
- AlChemy is an interesting AChem approach
- It is hard to understand the output and dynamics of ALChemy (and other AChem)
- We developed a python wrapper and visualization dashboard for high-throughput AlChemy experiments.
- We demonstrate the utility of these tools using a set of newly designed experiments drawn from recent advancements in prebiotic chemistry
- We simulations show that....
- We discuss the implications of this work for prebiotic chemistry, functional program design, and the future of machine learning.
