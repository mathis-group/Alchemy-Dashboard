# Visualizing an Algorithmic Artificial Chemistry for de novo functional exploration

## Abstract

- Artifical Chemistry aims to understand the self organization that leds to phenomena such as life
- AlChemy is an interesting AChem approach
- It is hard to understand the output and dynamics of ALChemy (and other AChem)
- We developed a python wrapper and visualization dashboard for high-throughput AlChemy experiments.
- We demonstrate the utility of these tools using a set of newly designed experiments drawn from recent advancements in prebiotic chemistry
- We simulations show that....
- We discuss the implications of this work for prebiotic chemistry, functional program design, and the future of machine learning. 


## Introduction

### Motivation for the Origin of Life

### Review of Recursive Experiments in Chemistry (Surman et al, Doran et al, Asche et al, Finkel-pinter et al)

### Review of AlChemy Simulations/Rules

### Review of AlChemy Papers


## Experimental Approach

### Visualizing AlChemy Dashboard
- This dashboard serves as a UI that allows users to interact with the Alchemy Core simulator and generate experiments and render interactive plots. This dashboard uses Python + Bokeh to achieve this task.

#### Design goals
- The main goal is to provide an easy to use UI interface for users to run experiments on and visualize the reults of collisions rendered by the Alchemy core simulator
- Users can upload JSON files to analyze/visualize experiment outcomes, perform time series analysis of their experiments as well as export and share their results.
- Users have the option to adjust the total number of collisions to run, polling frequency, random seed, generator type (between Fontana, Btree and uploaded files), Abstraction range, application range, max depth, min depth, max free variables, free variable probability, and initial expression count.
- There are 4 visualization plots that this dashboard generates
    - 1: Entropy Over time (The amount of disorder caused by lambda collisions over time)
    - 2: Unique expressions over time (How many unique expressions are formed by these collisions over time)
    - 3: State histogram at collision (lists the top 20 expressions by frequency
    - 4: AST visualization (creates an AST tree of selected lambda expression)
      
#### Implementation
- This dashboard is implemented through a combination of Python/Bokeh for the UI and Rust extensions that handle collision simulation
- Users have the choice of UV or vanilla pip to build python dependency of Rust extensions
- The overall structure goes like this: the user prodvides input to the UI -> the UI runs the simulation with the Alchemy core simulation -> experiment results are outputted -> the user also recieves interactive visualization plots generated by the alchemy dashboard.
